## 🗄️ **DATABASE SETUP - To Implement**

### **Supabase Tables Needed**
```sql
-- Core tables for production
1. issues (with GPS coordinates, photos, status tracking)
2. workers (with location, status, department, ratings)
3. worker_locations (real-time location tracking)
4. notifications (push notification management)
5. assignments (issue-worker mapping)
6. feedback (citizen ratings and reviews)
7. departments (municipal departments)
8. profiles (enhanced user profiles)
```

### **Real-Time Subscriptions**
```typescript
// WebSocket channels to set up
const realtimeChannels = {
  newIssues: "Live issue reports from citizens",
  workerLocations: "Worker GPS location updates",
  statusUpdates: "Issue status changes",
  assignments: "New task assignments",
  notifications: "Push notification triggers"
}
```

---

## 🚀 **INTEGRATION WORKFLOW**

### **1. Citizen Reports Issue (Mobile → Dashboard)**
```typescript
const citizenWorkflow = {
  step1: "Citizen takes photos of pothole",
  step2: "App captures precise GPS location",
  step3: "Citizen describes issue in Hindi/English", 
  step4: "Issue submitted to Supabase database",
  step5: "Admin dashboard shows new marker instantly",
  step6: "Admin reviews issue details and photos",
  step7: "Admin assigns to nearest available worker",
  step8: "Citizen gets acknowledgment notification"
}
```

### **2. Worker Completes Task (Mobile → Dashboard)**
```typescript
const workerWorkflow = {
  step1: "Worker receives assignment notification",
  step2: "Worker navigates to issue location",
  step3: "Worker updates status: 'Work Started'",
  step4: "Worker uploads progress photos",
  step5: "Worker marks task as 'Completed'",
  step6: "Admin verifies work from photos",
  step7: "Admin marks issue as 'Resolved'",
  step8: "Citizen gets completion notification + review form"
}
```
